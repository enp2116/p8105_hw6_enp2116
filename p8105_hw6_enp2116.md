    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"),

  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%

simple linear regression with tmax as the response and tmin as the
predictor, and are interested in the distribution of two quantities
estimated from these data: \* $\hat{r^2}$ \*
$log(\hat{\beta_0 * \beta_1})$

Use 5000 bootstrap samples and, for each bootstrap sample, produce
estimates of these two quantities. Plot the distribution of your
estimates, and describe these in words. Using the 5000 bootstrap
estimates, identify the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles to provide a 95%
confidence interval for $\hat{r^2}$ and $log(\hat{\beta_0 * \beta_1})$).
Note: broom::glance() is helpful for extracting r̂2 from a fitted
regression, and broom::tidy() (with some additional wrangling) should
help in computing $log(\hat{\beta_0 * \beta_1})$

# Problem 2

Reading in Washington Post homicide data:

``` r
raw_homicide_df =
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv")
```

Creating a city_state variable and a binary variable (outcome)
indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omitting cities Dallas, TX;
Phoenix, AZ; Kansas City; and MO Tulsa, AL. Limiting analysis those for
whom victim_race is white or black, and making sure that victim_age is
numeric.

``` r
tidy_homicide = 
  raw_homicide_df %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)) %>% 
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) %>% 
  filter(victim_race  %in% c( "Black", "White"))
```

For the city of Baltimore, MD, using the glm function to fit a logistic
regression with resolved vs unresolved as the outcome and victim age,
sex and race as predictors. Saving the output of glm as an R object;
applying the broom::tidy to this object; and obtaining the estimate and
confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides
comparing male victims to female victims keeping all other variables
fixed:

``` r
balt_log_fit = 
  tidy_homicide %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial()) 

balt_log_fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         est_low_CI = estimate - std.error * qnorm(0.975),
         est_high_CI = estimate + std.error * qnorm(0.975),
         OR_low_CI = exp(est_low_CI),
         OR_high_CI = exp(est_high_CI),
         ) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  select(term, OR, OR_low_CI, OR_high_CI, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term           |    OR | OR_low_CI | OR_high_CI | p.value |
|:---------------|------:|----------:|-----------:|--------:|
| victim_sexMale | 0.426 |     0.325 |      0.558 |       0 |

We are 95% confident that the adjusted odds ratio for solving homicides
comparing male victims to female victims keeping victim race and age
fixed is between 0.325 and 0.558. This means that when controlling for
the impacts of other victim-related variables, homicides in which the
victims are male are substantially less likely to be resolved that those
in which the victim is female.

Now running glm for each of the cities in my dataset, and extracting the
adjusted odds ratio (and CI) for solving homicides comparing male
victims to female victims. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use
of purrr::map, list columns, and unnest as necessary to create a
dataframe with estimated ORs and CIs for each city.

``` r
city_state_glms =
  tidy_homicide %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    glms = map(data, ~glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = ., family = binomial())),
    results = map(glms, broom::tidy)) %>% 
  select(-data, -glms) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         est_low_CI = estimate - std.error * qnorm(0.975),
         est_high_CI = estimate + std.error * qnorm(0.975),
         OR_low_CI = exp(est_low_CI),
         OR_high_CI = exp(est_high_CI),
         ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, OR_low_CI, OR_high_CI, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

Create a plot that shows the estimated ORs and CIs for each city.
Organize cities according to estimated OR, and comment on the plot.

# Problem 3

analyze data gathered to understand the effects of several variables on
a child’s birthweight

Load and clean the data for regression analysis (i.e. convert numeric to
factor where appropriate, check for missing data, etc.).

Propose a regression model for birthweight. This model may be based on a
hypothesized structure for the factors that underly birthweight, on a
data-driven model-building process, or a combination of the two.
Describe your modeling process and show a plot of model residuals
against fitted values – use add_predictions and add_residuals in making
this plot.

Compare your model to two others:

One using length at birth and gestational age as predictors (main
effects only) One using head circumference, length, sex, and all
interactions (including the three-way interaction) between these Make
this comparison in terms of the cross-validated prediction error; use
crossv_mc and functions in purrr as appropriate.

Note that although we expect your model to be reasonable, model building
itself is not a main idea of the course and we don’t necessarily expect
your model to be “optimal”.
